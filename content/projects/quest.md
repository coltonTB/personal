# Quest

At Honey, we built an experimental social network for shopping and deal hunting, internally called Quest. The idea was to allow Honey users to interact with eachother socially by contributing to a network of deal hunters. Using [Ice.js][ice-js], I built the front-end, supporting the following features:

+ 'Watch' products found while shopping on the internet
+ Post deals found for products that have been added to the site
+ Comment on deals posted by other users
+ Like deals posted by other users
+ Follow another user to get notifications for their activity on the site
+ Edit your user account with a profile picture, bio, email, and username
